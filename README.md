## Overview ##

Terraform provider for managing Redash configurations.

## Quick start ##

Assuming git is installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/terraform-provider-redash
 host> cd terraform-provider-redash
 host> make test
 host> make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
 host> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
 host> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.


## Installation

First download the pre-compiled binary for your platform from the release assets at the following links or generate the binaries locally using the provided `make` command:

https://github.com/snowplow-devops/terraform-provider-redash/releases/latest

From here you will need to move the binary into your Terraform plugins directory - depending on your platform / installation this might change but generally speaking they are located at:

* Darwin & Linux: `~/.terraform.d/plugins`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins`

## How to use?

### Setting up the provider

To actually start tracking Snowplow events from Terraform you will need to configure the `provider` and a `resource`:

Before using the provider, you will need an environment variable set with your personal API Key (which can be found in your Redash profile)
```bash
$ export REDASH_API_KEY="<YourPersonalAPIKeyHere>"
```

```hcl
# Minimal configuration
provider "redash" {
  redash_uri = "https://com.acme.redash"
}
```

With the provider configured, we can now use data sources and manage resources.

### Users ###
```hcl
data "redash_user" "rrunner" {
  id = 1
}

resource "redash_user" "wcoyote" {
  name   = "Wile E. Coyote"
  email  = "wcoyote@acme.com"
  groups = [32,1]
}

```

### Groups ###
```hcl
data "redash_group" "geniuses" {
  id = 35
}

resource "redash_group" "runners" {
  name = "Beep Beep"
}
```

### Data Sources ###

Please note that the list of required/accepted options varies wildly by type. This is entirely dependent on the Redash installation that you are connecting to. For a detailed list of types and options, you can GET from the `/api/data_sources/types` endpoint on your Redash instance.

```hcl
data "redash_data_source" "acme_corp" {
  id = 123
}

resource "redash_data_source" "acme_corp" {
   name = "ACME Corporation Product Database"
   type = "redshift"

   options {
     host     = "newproducts.acme.com"
     port     = 5439
     dbname   = "products"
     user     = "wcoyote"
     password = "eth3LbeRt"
    }
}

resource "redash_group_data_source_attachment" "wcoyote_acme" {
  group_id       = redash_group.geniuses.id
  data_source_id = redash_data_source.acme_corp.id
}
```

### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Github Actions. However all binaries will be generated by using the `make` command for local publishing.
